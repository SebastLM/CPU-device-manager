PROJECT

monitor CPU usage in different devices on the same network in real time(first only for linux systems, then make client code for windows systems and alter server to display them as well)


i need to make

 - server code to parse request and keep on showing them on the same line(changing the data seen in thoose lines 
   for the same ip)
   
 - handle sockets connections

 - make client code that keeps sending thoose requests 

 - store each output in a log file for that specific IP, maybe use threads so save each device there
 
 - worry about security for connections, make them have a kerberos type connection
 
 - make interface







I WILL also add a value which is the time the device as been booted from 

can also add a timer, if the PC as been booted in 6 hours my server, will send a code that will make the device shutdown
(use btime and calculate difference from current time and verify the difference, can have that running in a thread)

PROBLEMS:

 - server not printing usage
 - when the user disconnects make its traces dissapear and reajust the rest of the devices 
   (we can make it so that our client sends a sigint, it sends a different type of message to the server that parses it to do the reajusting)
